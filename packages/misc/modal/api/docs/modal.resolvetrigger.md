## ResolveTrigger type

The trigger that resolves the modal

- `backdrop`<!-- -->: non-static backdrop was clicked

- `x`<!-- -->: `x` button was clicked

- `escape`<!-- -->: `escape` key was pressed

- `clickoutside`<!-- -->: click outside of modal was detected

- `pop`<!-- -->: modal was resolved from by calling the `pop` method of the modal store

- `custom`<!-- -->: modal was resolved by a custom dispatch. Use this in your custom modal when extending the `resolve` event with additional props. See [ExtendedModalEvents](./modal.extendedmodalevents.md)
